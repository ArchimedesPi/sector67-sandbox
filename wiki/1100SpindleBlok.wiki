#summary A page for documentation of the HH Roberts spindle and SpindleBlok controller

= Introduction =
This page contains documentation of the Anilam 1100M mill's HH Roberts spindle and SpindleBlok controller.  The HH Roberts spindle head was an aftermarket add-on to the Anilam mill to replace a failed head, and as such was basically not integrated into the mill controls except for the three-phase power
