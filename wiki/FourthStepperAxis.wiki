#summary The fourth stepper axis implementation for our Anliam conversion

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =
As we started to implement 4th axis capability for our mills in earnest, we acquired a 8" horizontal/vertical rotary table with a stepper motor already integrated.  This led us to transition our effort away from the servo-based fourth axis described at FourthServoAxis to a stepper-based system.  It's a testament to the flexibility of EMC2 and our implementation that this really won't cause us to change much at all with respect to the implementation.  

It will give us a chance to work out some issues associated with integrating a stepper into a servo-based system.

== Stepper driver ==
The stepper drive we are using is labled DS335, and we were able to find datasheets and some integration information for it here:

== Stepper motor ==
The motor supplied is a NEMA 34 frame size stepper that otherwise has absolutely no specifications on the motor itself.  The phases are non-tapped, TODO: get Ohm resistance, and the motor seems functional with a 3.5 amp controller at ~30 volts.

== Rotary table ==

=== Backlash tuning ===

== Motor/table integration ==
Since the system already came as an integrated unit, this was very straightforward.  The stepper shaft is coupled to a coupler 

== EMC2 configuration ==
