#summary A page describing integration of a Delta VFD

= Introduction =

After a bad experience with a Huanyang VFD, we subsequently integrated a Delta TODO: get model

A table of changed settings
(this table is neither complete not correct currently)
|| Settings || Factory || Set to || Meaning ||
|| PD001    || 0       || 1      || Source of run commands is external terminal ||
|| PD002    || 0       || 1      || Operating frequencies controlled via external terminals ||
|| PD015    || 20.0    || 5.0    || Deceleration time #1 ||
|| PD030    || 0.0     || 5.0    || DC braking time at stop ||
|| PD031    || 2.0     || ?      || Increase slowly if braking does not stop the device. ||
|| PD026    || 0       || 0      || Decelerating stop (needed for braking) ||
|| PD028    || 0.5     || ?      || Stopping frequency.  Increase to apply braking sooner, not intended for deceleration, stopped braking only ||
|| PD044    || 02      || 02     || Configure input #1 (FOR) forward ||
|| PD045    || 03      || 03     || Configure input #2 (REV) forward ||
|| PD047    || 07      || 13     || Configure input #4 (SPH) as an external estop ||
|| PD048    || 19      || 13     || Configure input #5 (SPM) as an external estop ||
|| PD049    || 20      || 01     || Configure input #6 (SPL) as run enable (actually the drive does not function properly with run enable configured) ||
|| PD051    || 03      || 03     || Confirm Y2 output is fault indication.||

= Wires from the control head =

||Wire  || VFD Side       ||Control head side         || Meaning  ||
||Gray  || Sindle lock    ||                          ||          ||
||Purple|| REV            || Direction switch reverse ||          ||
||Orange|| FOR            || Direction switch forward ||          ||
||Brown || ACM            || Ground of speed POT and digital tach || Analog ground signal ||
||Tan   || 10V            || Top of speed POT || +10V reference for speed control ||
||Pink  || V0             || + signal of digital tach || Analog speed out ||
||Red   || +24V           ||                    || +24V for latch circuit ||
||Black || VI             || Wiper of speed POT || Analog speed signal in 
||Blue  || No Connection  || latched ground     || Intended to be a run enable signal ||

= Wires from spindle lock =

Spindle lock is normally closed, open when the spindle is locked
|| Wire || Use ||
|| Red || Gray signal wire to complete ground circuit. || Allows the spindle lock switch to be a part of estop ||
|| Black || DCM ||  Digital ground signal ||

= Wires from the Mesa card =
||Wire || Meaning ||
|| Orange       || + of the digital input      ||  Provides input to LinuxCNC when the spindle is faulted ||
|| Orange/white || Ground of the digital input || || 
|| Blue         || + of the isolated digital estop out || Provides output from LinuxCNC when the system is estopped ||
|| Blue/white   || Ground of the digital estop out     || ||


The braking resistor is ~40 ohms.
