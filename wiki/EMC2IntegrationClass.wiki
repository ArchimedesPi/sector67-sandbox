#summary An outline of the content of the Sector67 EMC2 Machine Integrator's class

Title: "Implementing CNC motion control with EMC2" 

Abstract:

If you have a working mill or are planning to build one and are interested in controlling it via computer.  This class will prepare attendees to convert or build the computer control system for a mill or other machine with the Linux-based open source EMC2 software suite.  The class will cover choosing and configuring the software, PC, I/O interface components, electronic interface hardware, motors and motor controllers needed to move a machine.  The actual mechanics of machine building (axes, lead screws, etc.) are not covered in this class.
