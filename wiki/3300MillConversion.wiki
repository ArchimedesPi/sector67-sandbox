#summary A 3-axis CNC mill conversion from Anilam 3300 controls to EMC2

=3300 mill conversion=
After the successful [ProjectSheetCake conversion] of our 1100 mill to EMC2 at [http://sector67.org Sector67] (and integration of a [FourthStepperAxis fourth-axis rotary table]), we are now tackling a conversion of our exsiting Anilam 3300 mill to EMC2 as well.  This page documents that effort.

=Sponsorship=
This conversion project has been sponsored by [http://compcc.com Comprehensive Computer Consulting].

In addition, this project would not be possible without significant volunteer effort from members of Sector67 and attendees of the EMC2 integrator's class, which used this project for various laboratory exercises.

=TODOs=
This project is still just beginning.  We have acquired much of the necessary hardware.  Remaining tasks include:

  * Video of this mill functioning so that when we extract the Anilam controls they can be sold.
  * Design and testing of the 24V estop circuit
  * Design and implementation of the limit switch/estop interface daughter board
  * Design and implementation of the 24V fan interface daughter board
  * Get an aluminium plate to mount all of the daughter boards, including the Mesa and other boards, and drill appropriate mounting holes for the standoffs.
  * Cut and wire the encoders to the Mesa servo daughter board
  * Cut and wire the servo amps to the Mesa servo daughter board
  * Wire the limits and fans and servo enable 
  * Determine a location for the PC and put it there.

Once these tasks are complete and the mill is basically functional, we can leverage much of the work on the increasingly misnamed 1100 mill for the EMC2 configuration.
