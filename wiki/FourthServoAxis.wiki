#summary The fourth servo axis implementation for our Anliam conversion

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =
This page provides more detail for our implementation of a fourth servo axis during our [ProjectSheetCake Anilam EMC2 conversion project].
= The hardware =
== The servo motor ==
== The encoder ==
The motors came with an encoder already attached.  Pulling the tape covering one side of the encoder revealed the manufacturer and part number:

Computer Optical Products, Inc.
CP550-1000LD-4895

from the data sheet at:

this is a CP-550 Incremental Digital Hollow Shaft Encoder with 1000 cycles per revolution and linedriver pinout.  The pinout of the 10 pin connector is:

||+5V||+5V||
||A||-A||
||B||-B|| ||
||A||I||
